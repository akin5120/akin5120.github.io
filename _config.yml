about_me_description: I’m a UX designer and researcher with a love for immersive design. I design experiences where technology adapts to people, from sports simulations powered by biofeedback to exergames that make rehabilitation playful. I’ve worked across UX research, service design, and immersive systems, building projects that connect design with human emotion, accessibility, and engagement. I enjoy blending research with prototyping and moving from insights to interactions. Outside of design, you’ll find me exploring new tech, designing 3D art and animations, or playing video games. At my core, I’m curious about how design, data, and storytelling can create digital experiences that feel more human.
